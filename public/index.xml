Backing up data frequently is of vital importance for the long lasting success of any organization. However, a backup of data is only valuable if data can be recovered/restored from the backup. In the cloud, backing up data and testing the restore is easier compared to on-premises datacenters. Automating this process with appropriate notification systems will ensure that an organization&amp;rsquo;s data is backed up frequently, the backups are tested to ensure expected recovery, and appropriate people are notified in case of failures.</description></item><item><title>Create Pricing Data Sources</title><link>https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/cost/200_labs/200_pricing_model_analysis/1_pricing_sources/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Feb 2021 11:16:09 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/cost/200_labs/200_pricing_model_analysis/1_pricing_sources/</guid><description>Create S3 Bucket and Folders Create a single S3 bucket that contains two folders - od_pricedata and sp_pricedata, these will contain the on-demand pricing data and the Savings Plans pricing data.

Leveraging bulkhead architectures and shuffle sharding techniques will provide additional reliability to workloads by limiting the blast radius of failures so that only a subset of users are impacted by such failures.</description></item><item><title>Deploying the infrastructure</title><link>https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/performance-efficiency/100_labs/100_monitoring_linux_ec2_cloudwatch/1_deploy_vpc/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Dec 2020 11:16:08 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/performance-efficiency/100_labs/100_monitoring_linux_ec2_cloudwatch/1_deploy_vpc/</guid><description>The CloudFormation template that accompanies this lab requires the ability to create IAM Roles and IAM Instance Profiles.

How do you implement change?
Best practice: Deploy changes with automation: Deployments and patching are automated to eliminate negative impact. Design principle: Manage change in automation: Changes to your infrastructure should be made using automation. The changes that need to be managed include changes to the automation, which then can be tracked and reviewed. When this lab is completed, you will have deployed and edited a CloudFormation template.</description></item><item><title>Deploy Lab Network Infrastructure</title><link>https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/operational-excellence/200_labs/200_automating_operations_with_playbooks_and_runbooks/1_deploy_the_lab_network_infrastructure/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Apr 2020 11:16:09 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/operational-excellence/200_labs/200_automating_operations_with_playbooks_and_runbooks/1_deploy_the_lab_network_infrastructure/</guid><description>In our first sections we will build a network infrastructure for our Application using Virtual Public Cloud (VPC) , along with it&amp;rsquo;s public and private subnets across two Availability Zones , and other basic network building blocks for accessing the internet such as Internet Gateway and NAT gateway To simplify the deployment we have created a CloudFormation Template that can be deployed in your AWS account that will deploy the VPC and Application resources shown in diagram below.</description></item><item><title>Deploy the CloudFormation Stack</title><link>https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/security/200_labs/200_remote_configuration_installation_and_viewing_cloudwatch_logs/1_deploy_cfn_stack/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Apr 2020 11:16:09 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/security/200_labs/200_remote_configuration_installation_and_viewing_cloudwatch_logs/1_deploy_cfn_stack/</guid><description>This portion of the lab shows you how to deploy an EC2 instance using a CloudFormation template.

To gather sufficient data, observe performance over at least a two-week period (ideally, over a one-month period) to capture the workload and business peak. The most common metrics that define instance performance are vCPU utilization, memory utilization, network utilization, and disk use.
Log into your AWS console via SSO, go to the Amazon CloudWatch service page: Select EC2 under the Service Dashboard: Observe the Service Dashboard and all of its different metrics, but focus on CPU Utilization and Network In and Out: Select one of the EC2 resources by clicking on the little color icon to the left of the resource-id name: Deselect the EC2 resource and now modify the time range on the top right, click custom and select the last 2 weeks: Navigate to the CPU Utilization Average widget, click the three dots and launch the View in metrics page.</description></item><item><title>Getting to know Amazon Cloudwatch</title><link>https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/cost/200_labs/200_aws_resource_optimization/1_cloudwatch_intro/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Apr 2020 11:16:09 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/cost/200_labs/200_aws_resource_optimization/1_cloudwatch_intro/</guid><description>NOTE: In order to run this lab you will need to have at least one EC2 instance running and have AWS Cost Explorer and Amazon EC2 Resource Optimization enabled.

A workload identifies a set of components that deliver business value. The workload is usually the level of detail that business and technology leaders communicate about. Workloads vary in levels of architectural complexity, from static websites to architectures with multiple data stores and many components.
Creating a workload We will start with creating a Well-Architected workload to use throughout this lab. Using the create-workload API , you can create a new Well-Architected workload: aws wellarchitected create-workload --workload-name &amp;quot;WA Lab Test Workload&amp;quot; --description &amp;quot;Test Workload for WA Lab&amp;quot; --review-owner &amp;quot;John Smith&amp;quot; --environment &amp;quot;PRODUCTION&amp;quot; --aws-regions &amp;quot;us-east-1&amp;quot; --lenses &amp;quot;wellarchitected&amp;quot; &amp;quot;serverless&amp;quot; The following are the required parameters for the command: workload-name - This is a uniquie identifier for the workload.</description></item><item><title>Scope of Impact of failures</title><link>https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/reliability/300_labs/300_fault_isolation_with_shuffle_sharding/2_impact_of_failures/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Dec 2020 11:16:09 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/reliability/300_labs/300_fault_isolation_with_shuffle_sharding/2_impact_of_failures/</guid><description>Break the application In the scenario used in the lab, the application has a known issue which is triggered by passing a &amp;ldquo;bad&amp;rdquo; query string. If such a request is received, the EC2 instance that handles the request will become unresponsive and the application will crash on the instance. The &amp;ldquo;bad&amp;rdquo; query string that triggers this is bug with a value of true. The development team is aware of this bug and are working on a fix, however, the issue exists today and customers might accidentally or intentionally trigger it.</description></item><item><title>Deploying an instance</title><link>https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/performance-efficiency/100_labs/100_monitoring_linux_ec2_cloudwatch/2_deploy_instance/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Dec 2020 11:16:08 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/performance-efficiency/100_labs/100_monitoring_linux_ec2_cloudwatch/2_deploy_instance/</guid><description>The CloudFormation template that accompanies this lab requires the ability to create IAM Roles and IAM Instance Profiles.

2.1 Use Restricted Administrator Role in Web Console A role specifies a set of permissions that you can use to access AWS resources that you need. In that sense, it is similar to a user in AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM). A benefit of roles is they allow you to enforce the use of an MFA token to help protect your credentials.</description></item><item><title>Basic Identity and Access Management User, Group, Role</title><link>https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/security/quests/quest_100_loft_introduction_to_security/2_basic_iam/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Apr 2020 11:16:09 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/security/quests/quest_100_loft_introduction_to_security/2_basic_iam/</guid><description>This hands-on lab will guide you through the introductory steps to configure AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM).

Setup your identity structure in the management account and use cross account access to access the child accounts. As you create roles for your users ensure that you are implementing least privilege access by ensuring that users only have access to perform actions required for their role. Be careful who you give permission to perform IAM actions as they can create their own permissions.</description></item><item><title>Configure Amazon CloudFront</title><link>https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/security/200_labs/200_automated_deployment_of_web_application_firewall/2_config_cloudfront/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Apr 2020 11:16:09 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/security/200_labs/200_automated_deployment_of_web_application_firewall/2_config_cloudfront/</guid><description>Using the AWS Management Console, we will create a CloudFront distribution, and link it to the AWS WAF ACL we previously created.

This will automatically update Athena/Glue when there are new versions and new months data for both reports.
The easiest way to work with multiple CURs is to deliver each CUR to a different S3 bucket, and follow the previous process. If you must deliver to a single bucket, configure your CURs with different prefixes or folders and follow this process.</description></item><item><title>Perform one off Fill of Member/Linked Data</title><link>https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/cost/300_labs/300_splitting_sharing_cur_access/2_backfill_data/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Apr 2020 11:16:09 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/cost/300_labs/300_splitting_sharing_cur_access/2_backfill_data/</guid><description>Perform this step if you want to generate data for all previous months available in your current CUR files.

If backups aren&amp;rsquo;t tested, you might find yourself in a situation where your workload has been impacted by an event and you need to recover data from your backups, but the backups are faulty and restoring data is not possible, or exceeds your RTO. To avoid such situations, backups taken should always be tested to ensure they can be used to recover data.</description></item><item><title>Saving a milestone</title><link>https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/well-architectedtool/200_labs/200_using_awscli_to_manage_wa_reviews/4_save_milestone/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Dec 2020 11:16:09 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/well-architectedtool/200_labs/200_using_awscli_to_manage_wa_reviews/4_save_milestone/</guid><description>Overview A milestone records the state of a workload at a particular point in time.
Save a milestone after you initially complete all the questions associated with a workload. As you change your workload based on items in your improvement plan, you can save additional milestones to measure progress.
A best practice is to save a milestone when you first do a new W-A review, or every time you make improvements to a workload.</description></item><item><title>Impact of failures with sharding</title><link>https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/reliability/300_labs/300_fault_isolation_with_shuffle_sharding/4_impact_of_failures_sharding/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Dec 2020 11:16:09 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/reliability/300_labs/300_fault_isolation_with_shuffle_sharding/4_impact_of_failures_sharding/</guid><description>Break the application We will now introduce the poison pill into the workload by including the bug query-string with our requests and see how the updated the workload architectures handles it.

Shuffle sharding is a combinatorial implementation of a sharded architecture. With shuffle sharding we create virtual shards with a subset of the capacity of the workload ensuring that the virtual shards are mapped to a unique subset of customers with no overlap. By minimizing the number of Workers a single customer is able to interact with within the workload, and spreading resources in a combinatorial way, we will be able to further reduce the impact of a potential posion pill.</description></item><item><title>Generate CPU and Memory load</title><link>https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/performance-efficiency/100_labs/100_monitoring_linux_ec2_cloudwatch/5_generating_load/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Dec 2020 11:16:08 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/performance-efficiency/100_labs/100_monitoring_linux_ec2_cloudwatch/5_generating_load/</guid><description>We have a CloudWatch dashboard to show us CPU and Memory statistics for the deployed EC2 instance.
