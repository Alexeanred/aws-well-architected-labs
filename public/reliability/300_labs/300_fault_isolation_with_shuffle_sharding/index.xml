Leveraging bulkhead architectures and shuffle sharding techniques will provide additional reliability to workloads by limiting the blast radius of failures so that only a subset of users are impacted by such failures.</description></item><item><title>Scope of Impact of failures</title><link>https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/reliability/300_labs/300_fault_isolation_with_shuffle_sharding/2_impact_of_failures/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Dec 2020 11:16:09 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/reliability/300_labs/300_fault_isolation_with_shuffle_sharding/2_impact_of_failures/</guid><description>Break the application In the scenario used in the lab, the application has a known issue which is triggered by passing a &amp;ldquo;bad&amp;rdquo; query string. If such a request is received, the EC2 instance that handles the request will become unresponsive and the application will crash on the instance. The &amp;ldquo;bad&amp;rdquo; query string that triggers this is bug with a value of true. The development team is aware of this bug and are working on a fix, however, the issue exists today and customers might accidentally or intentionally trigger it.</description></item><item><title>Implement sharding</title><link>https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/reliability/300_labs/300_fault_isolation_with_shuffle_sharding/3_implement_sharding/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Dec 2020 11:16:09 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/reliability/300_labs/300_fault_isolation_with_shuffle_sharding/3_implement_sharding/</guid><description>In this section we will update the architectural design of the workload and implement sharding. Similar to sharding a database where a large database or table is broken up into smaller chunks distributed across multiple servers, we will shard the overall capacity of the workload and segment it so that each shard is responsible for handling a subset of customers only. By minimizing the number of &amp;ldquo;components&amp;rdquo; a single customer is able to interact with within the workload, we will be able to reduce the impact of a potential posion pill.</description></item><item><title>Impact of failures with sharding</title><link>https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/reliability/300_labs/300_fault_isolation_with_shuffle_sharding/4_impact_of_failures_sharding/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Dec 2020 11:16:09 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/reliability/300_labs/300_fault_isolation_with_shuffle_sharding/4_impact_of_failures_sharding/</guid><description>Break the application We will now introduce the poison pill into the workload by including the bug query-string with our requests and see how the updated the workload architectures handles it.

Shuffle sharding is a combinatorial implementation of a sharded architecture. With shuffle sharding we create virtual shards with a subset of the capacity of the workload ensuring that the virtual shards are mapped to a unique subset of customers with no overlap. By minimizing the number of Workers a single customer is able to interact with within the workload, and spreading resources in a combinatorial way, we will be able to further reduce the impact of a potential posion pill.</description></item><item><title>Impact of failures with shuffle sharding</title><link>https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/reliability/300_labs/300_fault_isolation_with_shuffle_sharding/6_impact_of_failures_shuffle_sharding/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Dec 2020 11:16:09 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/reliability/300_labs/300_fault_isolation_with_shuffle_sharding/6_impact_of_failures_shuffle_sharding/</guid><description>Break the application We will now introduce the poison pill into the workload by including the bug query-string with our requests and see how the updated the workload architectures handles it.
