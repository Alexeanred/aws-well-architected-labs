Our API will be hosted inside docker containers orchestrated using Amazon Elastic Compute Service (ECS) with Application Load Balancer fronting it. The API will take 2 actions ; encrypt / decrypt. :
encrypt action will allow the user to pass on a secret message along with it&amp;rsquo;s key identifier, and it will return a secret key id that they can use to decrypt.</description></item><item><title>Simulate Application Issue</title><link>https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/operational-excellence/200_labs/200_automating_operations_with_playbooks_and_runbooks/2_simulate_application_issue/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Apr 2020 11:16:09 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/operational-excellence/200_labs/200_automating_operations_with_playbooks_and_runbooks/2_simulate_application_issue/</guid><description>In the previous section we have built a sample vpc environment with a deployed our application API running in it. In this section we will simulate a performance issue to trigger an alarm notifying our the operations team about the founded issue. In our scenario today we will assume a hypothetical API response SLA of under 6 seconds, if API response takes longer than 6 seconds broader user experience is severely impacted, and our Operations team needs to response to this.</description></item><item><title>Build &amp; Execute Investigative Playbook</title><link>https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/operational-excellence/200_labs/200_automating_operations_with_playbooks_and_runbooks/3_build_execute_investigative_playbook/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Apr 2020 11:16:09 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/operational-excellence/200_labs/200_automating_operations_with_playbooks_and_runbooks/3_build_execute_investigative_playbook/</guid><description>In the previous section, we have sent through large incoming traffic to the API to simulate an increase with the Application latency driven by the application being overwhelmed.
For a seasoned systems administrator / engineer, who knows the ins and outs of the application architecture and it&amp;rsquo;s general behaviour, investigating latency issue might be a relatively simple task to do. He / She would already know which service or components are involved in the application, and which metrics and data matters and which one don&amp;rsquo;t.</description></item><item><title>Build &amp; Execute Remediation Runbook</title><link>https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/operational-excellence/200_labs/200_automating_operations_with_playbooks_and_runbooks/4_build_execute_remediation_runbook/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Apr 2020 11:16:09 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/operational-excellence/200_labs/200_automating_operations_with_playbooks_and_runbooks/4_build_execute_remediation_runbook/</guid><description>In the previous section, we have built an automated playbook to investigate the application environment. The output the playbook gathered allows us to come up with a conclusion on the cause of the issue, and for us to decide the next course of action.
In this section we will build an automated Runbook to scale up the application cluster. The runbook will also send a notification for systems owner to give them the chance to intervene should they do not want this to go ahead.</description></item><item><title>Teardown</title><link>https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/operational-excellence/200_labs/200_automating_operations_with_playbooks_and_runbooks/5_cleanup/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Apr 2020 11:16:09 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/operational-excellence/200_labs/200_automating_operations_with_playbooks_and_runbooks/5_cleanup/</guid><description>Coming Soon</description></item></channel></rss>
