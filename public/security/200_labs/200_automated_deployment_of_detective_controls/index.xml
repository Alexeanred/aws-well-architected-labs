You can optionally configure AWS Config and Amazon GuardDuty by setting the CloudFormation parameter for each.

Note: If you are planning on doing the lab 300_Incident_Response_with_AWS_Console_and_CLI we recommend you only tear down this stack after completing that lab as their is a dependency on AWS CloudTrail being enabled for the other lab.
Delete the stack:
Sign in to the AWS Management Console, and open the CloudFormation console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/. Select the DetectiveControls stack.</description></item></channel></rss>
